  A comprehensive COCO-format extension of the BDD-OIA dataset with explicit 
  unsafe action labels and reason explanations. Designed for benchmarking 
  safety-aware vision-language models in autonomous driving scenarios.
  
  This dataset contains 22,924 images across train/val/test splits, each with:
  - One safe action (forward, stop, left, right, confuse)
  - One corresponding unsafe action (flipped for safety evaluation)
  - Multi-hot reason vector of 21 explanation categories
  
  Perfect for evaluating VLM safety understanding in driving contexts.
